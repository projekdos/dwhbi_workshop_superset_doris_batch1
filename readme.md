## Dashboard Preview

# Projek Cafe Sales Dashboard

**The sales dashboard for Projek Cafe** is designed to provide a real-time, comprehensive overview of the business's performance. The dashboard's primary function is to transform raw transaction data into actionable insights. It prominently features the following key indicators:

* **Total Sales:** A single, up-to-the-minute figure representing the total revenue generated in year. This provides a quick snapshot of daily financial performance.
* **Most Popular Item:** This metric identifies the best-selling product on the menu, allowing management to understand customer preferences and manage inventory effectively.
* **Peak Hour:** By highlighting the busiest hour of the day, the dashboard helps the cafe optimize staffing, anticipate demand, and ensure customer service quality during high-traffic periods.
